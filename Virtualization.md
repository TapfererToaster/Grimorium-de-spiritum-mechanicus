# Hypervisors
A hypervisor is a program, firmware or hardware that adds an abstraction layer on top of the physical hardware, which si used to create virtual machines. These virtual machines than have access to all the hardware of the physical machine (CPU, memory, disk controllers and NIC).
There are two types of hypervisors:
- **Bare Metal** 
  These hypervisors are installed directly on the hardware and than instances of operating systems are installed on the hypervisor.
  These are usually used on enterprise servers and data centers.
- **Hosted Hypervisor** 
  A hosted hypervisor is installed on top of an existing OS and then additional OS instances are installed on top of the hypervisor.
