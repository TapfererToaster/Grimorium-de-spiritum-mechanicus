>A program that does not get a user's input is a *deaf program*.

```Python
print("Tell me a secret...")
anything = input()
print("Hmm...", anything, "... That is a good secret.")
```
## Input Function with an Argument
You can use the `input` function to give a prompt to the user without the `print` function, like above.
```Python
secret = input("Tell me a secret")
print("Hmmm...", secret, "I will not tell anyone.")
```
