>The website that hosts the YAML specification (https://www.yaml.org) explicitly states that YAML stands for YAML Ain’t Markup Language and that “YAML is a human-friendly data serialization language for all programming languages.” So, YAML is primarily intended as a data serialization language, with the added goal of being as human-friendly as possible.
