# Clients and Servers
End devices can act as one of two roles in a network: clients and servers.
- A server provides services or resources to clients
- A client accesses the resources and services provided by a server

>[!note]
>Server and clients are not specific devices, they are roles and many devices can act as both, depending on the context.
>
>Although the term server is also used to refer to powerful computers, these are specifically designed and manufactured act as a server.


>[!info]
>Clients and servers are often called *endpoints* or *hosts*, as they are devices that communicate over the network.
>Opposed to network infrastructure devices, which connect the endpoints and facilitate their communication.

# Switches
Switches are a type of network infrastructure device, which are used to connect devices within a LAN. 
These devices are directly connected to the switch by connecting one end of a cable to the device and the other to a port on the switch. Because of this switches have usually 24 to 48 ports.

>[!note]
>A port is a physical connector and serve as a interface between two devices in a network. For that reason is the term port and interface often used interchangeably. 

# Routers
Routers are used to connect end hosts to external networks, mainly the internet.

>[!note] Routers and home routers
>Routers are not used to connect many end hosts within a LAN.
>The wireless router usually found in homes, typically fill the roles of a router, switch and wireless access point.
# Firewalls
Firewalls can be dedicated devices or software applications that protect the network or host device, by allowing or blocking certain network traffic.
>[!note]
>Firewall software like Microsoft Defender are known as *host-based firewalls*.
>A dedicated firewall device is called a *network firewall*.
